        <h1>Interesting Facts About the Solar System</h1>
        <p>While most of us are stuck on planet Earth, we're lucky enough to have a fairly transparent atmosphere. This
            allows us to look up at the sky and observe changes. The
            ancients noticed planets wandering across the sky, and occasional visitors such as comets.</p>
        <p>Thousands of years ago, most thought the stars ruled our destiny. Today, however, we can see science at work
            in the planets, asteroids and comets close to home. So why take
            a look at the Solar System? What can it teach us?</p>
        <h2>1. The definition of a planet and a moon is fuzzy.</h2>
        <p>We all know of that famous International Astronomical Union vote in 2006 where Pluto was demoted from
            planethood into a newly created class called “dwarf planets.” But the
        definition drew controversy among some, who pointed out that no planet — dwarf or otherwise — perfectly clears
            the neighborhood in its orbit of asteroids, for example. Moons
        are considered to orbit around planets, but that doesn't cover situations such as moons orbiting asteroids or
            double planets, for example. Goes to show you the Solar System
            requires more study to figure this out.</p>
        <h2>2. Comets and asteroids are leftovers.</h2>
        <p>No, we don't mean leftovers to eat — we mean leftovers of what the Solar System used to look like. So while
            it's easy to get distracted by the weather and craters and
        prospects for life on planets and moons, it's important to remember that we must also pay attention to the
            smaller bodies. Comets and asteroids, for example, could have
        brought organics and water ice to our own planet — providing what we need for life.</p>
        <h2>3. The planets are all on the same “plane” and orbit in the same direction.</h2>
        <p>When considering the IAU's definition of planets, we come up with eight: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
            Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. You'll notice that these bodies tend
        to follow the same path in the sky (called the ecliptic) and that they orbit the Sun in the same direction.
            That supports the leading theory for the Solar System's formation,
            which is that the planets and moons and Sun formed from a large gas and dust cloud that condensed and spun.
        </p>
        <h2>4. We're nowhere near the center of the galaxy.</h2>
        <p>We can measure vast distances across the universe by looking at things such as “standard candles” — a type
            of exploding stars that tend to have the same luminosity, which
        makes it easier to predict how far away they are from us. At any rate, looking at our neighborhood, we've been
            able to figure out we're nowhere near the Milky Way galaxy's
            center. We're about 165 quadrillion miles away from the center supermassive black hole, NASA says, which is
            probably a good thing.
        A still photo from an animated flythrough of the universe using SDSS data, This image shows our Milky Way
            Galaxy. The galaxy shape is an artist's conception, and each of the
            small white dots is one of the hundreds of thousands of stars as seen by the SDSS. Image credit: Dana Berry

        <h2>5. But the Solar System is bigger than you think.</h2>
        <p>Beyond the orbit of Neptune (the furthermost planet), it takes a long time to leave the Solar System. In
            2012, some 35 years after leaving Earth on a one-way trip to the outer
        solar Solar System, Voyager 1 passed through the area where the Sun's magnetic and gas environment gives way to
            that of the stars, meaning that it is interstellar space.
            That was an astounding 11 billion miles (17 billion kilometers) away from Earth, or roughly 118 equivalent
            Earth-sun distances (astronomical units).</p>
        <h2>6. The Sun is hugely massive.</h2>
        <p>Just how massive? 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in our local star, which goes to show you where the
            real heavyweight is. The Sun is made up of hydrogen and helium,
            which shows you that these gases are far more abundant in our neighborhood (and the Universe generally)
            than the rocks and metals we are more familiar with here on Earth</p>
